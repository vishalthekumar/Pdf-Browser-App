The PDF Browser App is a web application that allows users to search, view, and access PDFs. It connects to a remote API to fetch a list of PDFs, displays the PDFs with their details, and allows users to view the PDF by selecting it from the list. The app provides an interactive interface where users can filter PDFs based on the author's name and view more information about the PDFs.
